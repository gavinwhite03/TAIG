          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            In today‚Äôs world, athletes are surrounded by countless sources of information on strength and conditioning, rehabilitation, sport psychology, and performance science. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to separate credible, evidence-based insights from misinformation. Too often, advice is presented as a one-size-fits-all solution, yet every athlete is unique, and what works for one may not work for another.
            <br />At The Athletes‚Äô Insider Guide (TAIG), our mission is to provide athletes of all ages with scientifically grounded information that empowers them to better understand their own performance and development. We aim to help athletes, coaches, parents, and support staff make informed decisions by offering accurate, research-based resources.
            <br />Our goal is not only to share reliable information but also to encourage continued learning. We invite all visitors to explore our recommended readings and resources, created and curated by professionals in the field, to deepen their understanding and take control of their athletic journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you're a competitive athlete, weekend warrior, or fitness enthusiast, we believe 
            you deserve access to the same evidence-based strategies used by elite performers.

I obtained a first-class honors degree in sport and exercise science from York St. John University, where I played for i2i Soccer Academy. I grew up playing several sports, but eventually decided to focus on soccer. I have competed at the amateur and semi-pro levels in the UPSL and NPSL in the US. My interest in sports psychology began in my first year of university when I took a class that highlighted the growing need for mental skills coaching and psychological services for athletes and individuals of all ages. There is a stigma around sports psychology, but the main goal of sports and performance psychology is to help individuals develop the mental skills to enhance their overall performance in sport.</p>
